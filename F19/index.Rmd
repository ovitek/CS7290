<h1> Topics in Statistical Inference, Fall 2019 </h1>
<h2>Tue and Fri 9:50pm - 11:30pm, Ryder Hall 153</h2>

The course introduces methods of statistical inference, useful in any area of science that collects and analyzes data. The course overviews Bayesian and frequentist characterization of uncertainty for continuous and categorical data, principles of experimental design, and methods of causal inference. The course discusses the methodological foundations, as well as issues of practical implementation and use. Methods discussed in this class are applicable to a broad range of problems, from design and analysis of empirical studies of complex real-life phenomena, to design and analysis of evaluations of computer experiments or computer science research. The course work includes a term project involving programming and/or work with real-life investigations.
